-- SUMMARY --

Sky is a minimal, re-colorable, multi-column theme which uses the 960 Grid
System and HTML5. Supported browsers include IE6+, FF3+, Safari 3+, Chrome and Opera 10+. Please note that Sky is not an administrative theme.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

In order to view the live preview on the color settings page
(admin/appearance/settings/sky), you must install the Color Theme module. It is
a very small module that sets the current theme to theme that's being
configured. This allows for live previews of the color schemes and
customization. It is not technically required, but highly recommended:

-- INSTALLATION --

Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Color options: Enable the theme at admin/appearance, and visit
  admin/appearance/settings/sky to modify the color scheme if desired.
* Menus: The Sky theme does not support the hard coded menu defaults. To setup
  your main navigation menu, place the block containing the menu you want in the
  "Navigation" region.


-- FAQ --

* Skinr Integration: When the Skinr module is available many more block styles,
including drop down menus will be added.
